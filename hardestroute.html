            Hardest Route was created by a multi-disciplinary team for the 2023 Global Game Jam.

            I worked collaboratively with another programmer, two asset artists and a concept artist. We started by
            brainstorming ideas,
            settled on a slight twist to the given theme “root”, and decided to go with “route”. We wanted the game
            to
            stand
            out and be different,
            and I believe we accomplished this with our unusual game objective of taking as much damage as possible.
            The
            player takes on the role
            of a masochist who earns points when they take damage. Therefore, it is their objective to take as much
            damage
            as possible before the
            timer runs out. Enemies become exhausted from attacking after a while so their stamina acts as health.
            To
            reach
            the highest scores,
            the player must find the best route which contains the most enemies!

            Our Game was featured first in the Norwich University of the Arts Global Game Jam showreel!
