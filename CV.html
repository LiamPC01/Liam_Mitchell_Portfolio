    <h3><u>Profile</u></h3>
    <p>
        I am a dedicated programmer with a desire to learn new skills and improve my current ones. <br />
        I am interested in creating games and software applications.<br />
        I am currently in my 2nd year of the Game Development course at Norwich University of the Arts.<br />
        I spend most of my time learning to program, which I do through personal projects outside of the university.<br />
        I believe self-study, experimentation and exploration of interesting topics is the best way to learn.<br />
