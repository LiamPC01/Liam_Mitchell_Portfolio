        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>
            Create a user-friendly web application that enables users to catalog books, input detailed information about
            each book (such as title, author, and the number of pages), and track their reading status. Users can
            then
            view their collection in a visually engaging and personalized virtual library.
        </p>

            Identified key features and design elements that enhance user experience.
        </p>
        <p><b>Design:</b></p>
        <p>
            Created <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/FYKBIr2WFDepmJYAKjrzim/Library?m=dev&node-id=0-1" class="textLink" target="_blank">initial sketches</a> and wireframes to conceptualize the layout and user interface.
            Developed detailed mockups using design tools to ensure a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design.
            
        </p>
        <p><b>Development:</b></p>
        <p>
            HTML Structure: Built the fundamental structure of the web app using HTML5, ensuring semantic and accessible
            markup.
            JavaScript Functionality: Implemented core functionalities with JavaScript, such as adding new books,
            updating
            book information, and tracking reading status.
            CSS Styling: Applied CSS3 to style the web app, focusing on creating a visually appealing interface with
            responsive design elements to ensure usability across various devices.
            
        </p>
        <p><b>Testing and Iteration:</b></p>
        <p>
            Conducted rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs, and refine the user interface.
            Gathered feedback from initial users to make further improvements and enhance usability.

            Successfully designed and developed a visually appealing and fully functional web application that allows
            users
            to create and manage their own virtual library. The app features an intuitive interface, smooth
            interactions,
            and a personalized experience, making it easy for users to track and organize their reading habits. User
