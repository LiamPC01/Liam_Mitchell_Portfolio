        I am interested in audio and music, so I learnt the fundamentals of middleware Wwise and integrated it
        into
        Unreal Engine.
        <br />
        In this project, I have implemented dynamic footsteps. With each step the player takes, a line trace is
        drawn
        directly downwards from the
        character model's foot to the ground. Depending on what physics material the line trace hits a different
        sound
        will be played. Sound
        attenuation and positioning have been applied to a wood burner so that the player can tell what
        direction
        the
        sound is coming from
        (if they are wearing headphones) and once they are close enough the sound will envelop them. RTPCs
        (Real-Time
        Parameter Controls)
        are utilized to play, increase, and decrease the volume of a heartbeat sound depending on the player’s
        health.
        Once the player’s health
        drops below a threshold the sound will play quietly but will increase as the player’s health falls and
        decreases
        if it rises until it stops
        playing altogether.
