                <p>
                    I created Dungeon Slasher in Unreal Engine primarily using C++ and a small amount of Unreal visual
                    scripting
                    language blueprint.<br><br>
                    
                    I love
                    melee combat in video games, so I attempted to create my own!
                    The combat is methodical, where the player must time their blocks to the enemy attacks, as blocks
                    cannot
                    be
                    held. Attacking and blocking
                    consume stamina, but attacking costs much more, so the player is punished for spamming their
                    attacks.
                    This
                    encourages a back-and-forth
                    between attacking and blocking.<br><br>
                    The enemies have basic AI, which allows them to patrol and chase the player when they enter their
                    cone
                    of
                    vision. When within range, the
                    enemy will begin their attack windup, and once they have reached the attack of the animation, a line
                    trace
                    will
                    be drawn forward.
                    If the line trace hits the player, the enemy class casts to the player class to determine whether
                    they
                    are
                    blocking, and then the appropriate
                    functions are called. Player attacking works similarly.
                    <br><br>Check out the GitHub Repository below if youâ€™re interested! To keep on track during this project, I
                    used
                    Jira to
                    prioritise tasks, a Gantt chart to have a complete development timeline and GitHub to have source
                    control.</p>
