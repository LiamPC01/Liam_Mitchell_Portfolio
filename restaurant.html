        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>
            To create a modular, dynamic restaurant website with a Webcore/Old Internet theme, optimized for both
            desktop and mobile, using JavaScript and Webpack, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
        </p>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
            I set up the project environment with Webpack, configuring it to bundle the application efficiently. The
            website was designed with a Webcore/Old Internet aesthetic, ensuring a nostalgic yet responsive design.
            Using modular JavaScript, I created separate modules for the homepage, menu, and contact pages, and
            implemented event listeners for dynamic tab-switching. I also optimized the layout to ensure it looks and
            functions well on mobile devices. Finally, I deployed the project to GitHub Pages, hosting the build output
            on a gh-pages branch.
        </p>


        <h2>The Outcome</h2>
        <p>
            The project resulted in a fully functional, mobile-friendly restaurant website with a unique Webcore/Old
            Internet theme and a clean, modular codebase. The site was successfully deployed to GitHub Pages, offering a
            responsive and visually appealing experience across both desktop and mobile platforms. Skills utilized
            included
            Webpack configuration, JavaScript modularization, DOM manipulation, mobile optimization, and deployment via
            GitHub Pages.
