    <h3>Dungeon Slash</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        I created Dungeon Slasher in Unreal Engine primarily using C++ and a small amount of Unreal visual scripting language blueprint. I love melee<br />
        combat in video games, so I attempted to create my own!<br />
        <br />
        The combat is methodical, where the player must time their blocks to the enemy attacks, as blocks cannot be held. Attacking and blocking<br />
        consume stamina, but attacking costs much more, so the player is punished for spamming their attacks. This encourages a back-and-forth<br />
        between attacking and blocking.<br />
        <br />
        The enemies have basic AI, which allows them to patrol and chase the player when they enter their cone of vision. When within range, the<br />
        enemy will begin their attack windup, and once they have reached the attack of the animation, a line trace will be drawn forward.<br />
        If the line trace hits the player, the enemy class casts to the player class to determine whether they are blocking, and then the appropriate<br />
        functions are called. The code is shown below. Player attacking works similarly.<br />
        <br />
        Check out the GitHub Repository below if you’re interested! To keep on track during this project, I used Jira to prioritise tasks, a Gantt<br />chart to have a complete development timeline and GitHub to have source control.<br />

    <h3>Wwise Unreal Switch Footstep</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        I am interested in audio and music, so I learnt the fundamentals of middleware Wwise and integrated it into Unreal Engine.<br />
        <br />
        In this project, I have implemented dynamic footsteps. With each step the player takes, a line trace is drawn directly downwards from the<br /> 
        character model's foot to the ground. Depending on what physics material the line trace hits a different sound will be played. Sound attenuation<br />
        and positioning have been applied to a wood burner so that the player can tell what direction the sound is coming from<br />
        (if they are wearing headphones) and once they are close enough the sound will envelop them. RTPCs (Real-Time Parameter Controls)<br /> 
        are utilized to play, increase, and decrease the volume of a heartbeat sound depending on the player’s health. Once the player’s health drops below<br /> 
        a threshold the sound will play quietly but will increase as the player’s health falls and decreases if it rises until it stops playing altogether.<br />

    <h3>Hardest Route</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Hardest Route was created over a weekend for the 2023 Global Game Jam.<br />
        Our team was made up of two programmers, two asset artists and one concept artist.<br />
        Hardest Route is a Dungeon Crawler where the player must try to take as much damage as possible<br />
        before the timer runs out. They can achieve this by taking the route through the level with<br />
        the most enemies. <br />
        Shown below in the NUA Global Game Jam showcase reel as the first video.<br />

    <h3>Raycasting with JavaScript P5</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        I created this Raycasting project in my 3rd year individually for University.<br />
        I was intrigued by 90s shooters like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D at the time.<br />
        This project was used in my essay on Raycasting. I used a course on Pikuma.com for this project.<br />

    <h3>To-Do List</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        This is a programming project I wrote while learning C++. <br />
        It is a simple To-Do List program which allows the user to input tasks to the list,<br />
        and delete them when they are completed.
