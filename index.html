    <h3>Hardest Root</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Hardest Root was created over a weekend for the 2023 Global Game Jam.<br />
        Our team was made up of two programmers, two asset artists and one concept artist.<br />
        Hardest Root is a Dungeon Crawler where the player must try to take as much damage as possible<br />
        before the timer runs out. They can achieve this by taking the route through the level with<br />
        the most enemies. <br/>
        Shown below in the NUA Global Game Jam showcase reel as the first video.<br />

    <h3>Dungeon Slasher (Work In Progress)</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Dungeon Slasher is a game with an emphasis on first person melee combat with a fantasty setting.<br />
        I am using project managament and source control tools such as Jira and GitHub.<br/>
        I have also created a Gantt chart to have a development timeline for my project.<br/>

    <h3>Space Cat Nip</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Space Cat Nip was created in Unreal by a team of three, <br />
        two programmers and one artist, over a weekend for the 2022 Global Game Jam.<br />
        It is a third person action platformer where the player must reach the end of each<br />
        level to retrieve their lost cat nip whilst leaping accross dangerous low gravity jumps<br />
        and shooting angry robots. I programmed using C++ and designed the levels.<br />

    <h3>HyperSpace Ace</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        I created HyperSpace Ace individually for University.<br />
        It is an endless runner where the goal is to gain as much speed as possible,<br />
        if you hit an obstacle you lose speed.

    <h3>To-Do List</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        This is an independent programming project I wrote. <br />
        It is a simple To-Do List program which allows the user to input tasks to the list,<br />
        and delete them when they are completed.

    <h3>Expense Tracker</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Here is another independent programming project. <br />
        This program keeps track of your spending.<br />
        The user can input the name, price and date of purchase of an item, <br />
        then they can view the items they have added.
