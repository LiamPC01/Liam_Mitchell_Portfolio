    <h2>Dungeon Slash</h2>
    <p>

        I created Dungeon Slasher in Unreal Engine primarily using C++ and a small amount of Unreal visual scripting
        language blueprint. I love
        melee combat in video games, so I attempted to create my own!
        <br />
        The combat is methodical, where the player must time their blocks to the enemy attacks, as blocks cannot be
        held. Attacking and blocking
        consume stamina, but attacking costs much more, so the player is punished for spamming their attacks. This
        encourages a back-and-forth
        between attacking and blocking.
        <br />
        The enemies have basic AI, which allows them to patrol and chase the player when they enter their cone of
        vision. When within range, the
        enemy will begin their attack windup, and once they have reached the attack of the animation, a line trace will
        be drawn forward.
        If the line trace hits the player, the enemy class casts to the player class to determine whether they are
        blocking, and then the appropriate
        functions are called. The code is shown below. Player attacking works similarly.
        <br />
        Check out the GitHub Repository below if you’re interested! To keep on track during this project, I used Jira to
        prioritise tasks, a Gantt chart to have a complete development timeline and GitHub to have source control.

    <h2>Mini Jame Gam - Box Game</h2>

    <p>
        For the “Mini Jame Game” I worked with another programmer to create the creatively named Box Game.<br />
        The player uses a vacuum gun to hoover boxes which they can then use as projectiles.<br />
        We have continued to work on this project after the game jam ended and I have recently been working<br />
        on a new Portal inspired level which uses buttons which require x number of boxes to open the connected
        door.<br />
        Developed in Unreal Engine with C++<br />

    <h2>Wwise Unreal Switch Footstep</h2>

    <p>
        I am interested in audio and music, so I learnt the fundamentals of middleware Wwise and integrated it into
        Unreal Engine.
        <br />
        In this project, I have implemented dynamic footsteps. With each step the player takes, a line trace is drawn
        directly downwards from the
        character model's foot to the ground. Depending on what physics material the line trace hits a different sound
        will be played. Sound
        attenuation and positioning have been applied to a wood burner so that the player can tell what direction the
        sound is coming from
        (if they are wearing headphones) and once they are close enough the sound will envelop them. RTPCs (Real-Time
        Parameter Controls)
        are utilized to play, increase, and decrease the volume of a heartbeat sound depending on the player’s health.
        Once the player’s health
        drops below a threshold the sound will play quietly but will increase as the player’s health falls and decreases
        if it rises until it stops
        playing altogether.

    <h2>Hardest Route</h2>

    <p>
        Hardest Route was created by a multi-disciplinary team for the 2023 Global Game Jam.
        <br />
        I worked collaboratively with another programmer, two asset artists and a concept artist. We started by
        brainstorming ideas,
        settled on a slight twist to the given theme “root”, and decided to go with “route”. We wanted the game to stand
        out and be different,
        and I believe we accomplished this with our unusual game objective of taking as much damage as possible. The
        player takes on the role
        of a masochist who earns points when they take damage. Therefore, it is their objective to take as much damage
        as possible before the
        timer runs out. Enemies become exhausted from attacking after a while so their stamina acts as health. To reach
        the highest scores,
        the player must find the best route which contains the most enemies!
        <br />
        Our Game was featured first in the Norwich University of the Arts Global Game Jam showreel!

    <h2>Raycasting in JavaScript with P5</h2>

    <p>
        Being a fan of early “3D” shooters such as Doom and Blood, I thought I would attempt to create a raycasting
        engine for one of my university
        projects in JavaScript using the P5 library. I mainly studied raycasting by reading the Wolfenstein 3D Black
        Book and purchasing a course on
        Pikuma.com. This project was exciting to work on and allowed me to brush up on basic mathematics, as raycasting
        engines require trigonometry
        when calculating the direction of each ray.
