    <h2>Dungeon Slash</h2>

    <p>
        I created Dungeon Slasher in Unreal Engine primarily using C++ and a small amount of Unreal visual scripting language blueprint. I love<br />
        melee combat in video games, so I attempted to create my own!<br />
        <br />
        The combat is methodical, where the player must time their blocks to the enemy attacks, as blocks cannot be held. Attacking and blocking<br />
        consume stamina, but attacking costs much more, so the player is punished for spamming their attacks. This encourages a back-and-forth<br />
        between attacking and blocking.<br />
        <br />
        The enemies have basic AI, which allows them to patrol and chase the player when they enter their cone of vision. When within range, the<br />
        enemy will begin their attack windup, and once they have reached the attack of the animation, a line trace will be drawn forward.<br />
        If the line trace hits the player, the enemy class casts to the player class to determine whether they are blocking, and then the appropriate<br />
        functions are called. The code is shown below. Player attacking works similarly.<br />
        <br />
        Check out the GitHub Repository below if you’re interested! To keep on track during this project, I used Jira to prioritise tasks, a Gantt<br />chart to have a complete development timeline and GitHub to have source control.<br />

    <h2>Wwise Unreal Switch Footstep</h2>

    <p>
        I am interested in audio and music, so I learnt the fundamentals of middleware Wwise and integrated it into Unreal Engine.<br />
        <br />
        In this project, I have implemented dynamic footsteps. With each step the player takes, a line trace is drawn directly downwards from the<br />
        character model's foot to the ground. Depending on what physics material the line trace hits a different sound will be played. Sound<br />
        attenuation and positioning have been applied to a wood burner so that the player can tell what direction the sound is coming from<br />
        (if they are wearing headphones) and once they are close enough the sound will envelop them. RTPCs (Real-Time Parameter Controls)<br />
        are utilized to play, increase, and decrease the volume of a heartbeat sound depending on the player’s health. Once the player’s health<br />
        drops below a threshold the sound will play quietly but will increase as the player’s health falls and decreases if it rises until it stops<br />
        playing altogether.

    <h2>Hardest Route</h2>

    <p>
        Hardest Route was created by a multi-disciplinary team for the 2023 Global Game Jam.<br />
        <br />
        I worked collaboratively with another programmer, two asset artists and a concept artist. We started by brainstorming ideas,<br />
        settled on a slight twist to the given theme “root”, and decided to go with “route”. We wanted the game to stand out and be different,<br />
        and I believe we accomplished this with our unusual game objective of taking as much damage as possible. The player takes on the role<br />
        of a masochist who earns points when they take damage. Therefore, it is their objective to take as much damage as possible before the<br />
        timer runs out. Enemies become exhausted from attacking after a while so their stamina acts as health. To reach the highest scores,<br />
        the player must find the best route which contains the most enemies!<br />
        <br />
        Our Game was featured first in the Norwich University of the Arts Global Game Jam showreel!

    <h2>Raycasting in JavaScript with P5</h2>

    <p>
        Being a fan of early “3D” shooters such as Doom and Blood, I thought I would attempt to create a raycasting engine for one of my university<br />
        projects in JavaScript using the P5 library. I mainly studied raycasting by reading the Wolfenstein 3D Black Book and purchasing a course on<br />
        Pikuma.com. This project was exciting to work on and allowed me to brush up on basic mathematics, as raycasting engines require trigonometry<br />
        when calculating the direction of each ray.
