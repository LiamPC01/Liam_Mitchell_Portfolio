        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>
            To develop a modular To-Do List application that allows users to create, manage, and complete tasks. Built
            with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app is bundled with Webpack for efficiency.
        </p>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
            I began by setting up the project environment with Webpack, ensuring an efficient build process for modular
            JavaScript. The application was structured with separate modules to handle task creation, completion, and
            filtering, enabling scalability and maintainability. The UI was styled with CSS for a clean and intuitive
            design. Using DOM manipulation and event listeners, I implemented dynamic features such as marking tasks as
            complete and automatically sorting tasks by date. Finally, the project was deployed to GitHub Pages for
            public access.


        </p>


        <h2>The Outcome</h2>
        <p>
            The final product is a fully functional To-Do List app with a clean, modular codebase and efficient task
            management features. The app automatically sorts tasks by date, ensuring a prioritized and organized
            experience. The app provides a user-friendly interface and is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy accessibility.
            Key skills demonstrated include Webpack configuration, JavaScript modularization, DOM manipulation, and
            deployment via GitHub Pages.
