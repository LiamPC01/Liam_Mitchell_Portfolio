        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>
            To develop a modular To-Do List application that allows users to create, manage, and complete tasks.<br><br>

            Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app is bundled with Webpack for efficiency.<br>

        </p>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
            I began by setting up the project environment with Webpack, ensuring an efficient build process for modular
            JavaScript.<br><br>

            The application was structured with separate modules to handle task creation, completion, and filtering,
            enhancing scalability and maintainability.<br><br>

            The UI was styled with CSS for a clean and intuitive design.<br><br>

            Using DOM manipulation and event listeners, I implemented dynamic features such as marking tasks as complete
            and automatically sorting tasks by date.<br><br>

            Finally, the project was deployed to GitHub Pages for public access.<br>

        </p>

        <div class="media-container">
            <a href="Media/saveSelectedProject.png" target="_blank">
                <img src="Media/saveSelectedProject.png">
            </a>

        </div>
        
        <p>In the above code snippet, I first import the selected project object from my <b>projectManager</b>
            module.<br><br>

            In the <b>saveSelectedProject</b> function, I first check whether the array of todos in my project has more
            than 0 elements. If it does, we can begin looping through the array.<br><br>

            Each todo is then assigned a key for each of its member variables (name, description, due date), which will
            look something like <b>inboxTaskName[4]</b> with the appropriate value assigned to it.<br><br>

            Once the loop has ended, the size of the array is saved to local storage. This ensures that later, when we
            want to retrieve our projects using the <b>loadSelectedProject</b> function, we know how many iterations are
            needed.<br><br>

            You may have noticed that, in addition to the task due date, there is also a timestamp. The timestamp is an
            integer initialized with a size proportional to the task due date. This makes it simple to keep the todos
            sorted in order of date.<br>
        </p>


        <h2>The Outcome</h2>
        <p>
            The final product is a fully functional To-Do List app with a clean, modular codebase and efficient task
            management features.<br><br>

            The app automatically sorts tasks by date, ensuring a prioritized and organized experience.<br><br>

            It provides a user-friendly interface and is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy accessibility.<br><br>

            Key skills demonstrated include Webpack configuration, JavaScript modularization, DOM manipulation, and
            deployment via GitHub Pages.<br>
