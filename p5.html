            Being a fan of early “3D” shooters such as Doom and Blood, I thought I would attempt to create a
            raycasting
            engine for one of my university
            projects in JavaScript using the P5 library. I mainly studied raycasting by reading the Wolfenstein 3D
            Black
            Book and purchasing a course on
            Pikuma.com. This project was exciting to work on and allowed me to brush up on basic mathematics, as
            raycasting
            engines require trigonometry
            when calculating the direction of each ray.
