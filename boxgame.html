            For the “Mini Jame Game” I worked with another programmer to create the creatively named Box Game.
            The player uses a vacuum gun to hoover boxes which they can then use as projectiles.
            We have continued to work on this project after the game jam ended and I have recently been
            working
            on a new Portal inspired level which uses buttons which require x number of boxes to open the connected
            door.
            Developed in Unreal Engine with C++
